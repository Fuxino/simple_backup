.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR simple_backup
is a python script for performing backup of files and folders. It uses rsync to copy the files to the specified location.
Parameters for the backup such as input files/directories, output location and files or folders to exclude can be specified
in a configuration file (default location $HOME/.config/simple_backup/simple_backup.conf) or directly on the command line.
Parameters specified on the command line will override those in the configuration file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a short help message and exit
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-config FILE
Specify the configuration file, useful to specify a different one from the default.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input INPUT [INPUT...]
Specify the files and directories to backup. Multiple inputs can be specified, just separate them with a space.
If filenames or paths contain spaces, don't forget to escape them, or to use single or double quotes around them.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output DIR
Specify the directory where the files will be copied. The program will automatically create a subdirectory called
\(aqsimple_backup\(aq (if it does not already exist) and inside this directory the actual backup directory (using
the current date and time)
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-exclude FILE|DIR|PATTERN [FILE|...]]
Specify files, directories or patterns to exclude from the backup. Matching files and directories will not be copied.
Multiple elements can be specified, in the same way as for the \-\-input option
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keep N
Specify how many old backups (so excluding the current one) will be kept. The default behavior is to keep them all
(same as N=\-1)
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-checksums
Same as rsync option \(aq\-\-checksum\(aq, use checksums instead of mod\-time and size to skip files.
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-before\-backup
Remove old backups (if necessary) before creating the new backup. Useful to free some space before performing the backup.
Default behavior is to remove old backups after successfully completing the backup.
.SH CONFIGURATION
An example configuration file is provided at \(aq/etc/simple_backup/simple_backup.conf\(aq. Copy it to the default location
($HOME/.config/simple_backup) and edit it as needed.
