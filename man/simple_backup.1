.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR simple_backup
is a python script for performing backup of files and folders. It uses rsync to copy the files
to the specified location. Parameters for the backup such as input files/directories, output
location and files or folders to exclude can be specified
in a configuration file (default location $HOME/.config/simple_backup/simple_backup.conf)
or directly on the command line.
Parameters specified on the command line will override those in the configuration file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a short help message and exit
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-config FILE
Specify the configuration file, useful to specify a different one from the default.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input INPUT [INPUT...]
Specify the files and directories to backup. Multiple inputs can be specified, just separate
them with a space. If filenames or paths contain spaces, don't forget to escape them,
or to use single or double quotes around them.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output DIR
Specify the directory where the files will be copied. The program will automatically
create a subdirectory called \(aqsimple_backup\(aq (if it does not already exist) and
inside this directory the actual backup directory (using the current date and time)
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-exclude FILE|DIR|PATTERN [FILE|...]]
Specify files, directories or patterns to exclude from the backup. Matching files and directories
will not be copied. Multiple elements can be specified, in the same way as for the \-\-input option
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keep N
Specify how many old backups (so excluding the current one) will be kept. The default behavior
is to keep them all (same as N=\-1)
.TP
.B \-\-host HOSTNAME
Hostname of the server where to copy the files in case of remote backup through ssh
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-username USERNAME
Username for connecting to the server in case of remote backup
.TP
.B \-\-keyfile FILE
Location of the SSH key for server authentication. 
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-checksums
Same as rsync option \(aq\-\-checksum\(aq, use checksums instead of mod\-time and size
to skip files.
.TP
.B \-z, \-\-compress
Compress data during transfer (rsync \(aq\-\-compress\(aq option). Useful for remote backup
if saving bandwith is needed.
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-before\-backup
Remove old backups (if necessary) before creating the new backup. Useful to free some space
before performing the backup.
Default behavior is to remove old backups after successfully completing the backup.
.SH CONFIGURATION
An example configuration file is provided at \(aq/etc/simple_backup/simple_backup.conf\(aq.
Copy it to the default location ($HOME/.config/simple_backup) and edit it as needed.
.SH REMOTE BACKUP
It is possible to choose a directory on a remote server as destination for the backup. The files
are copied by rsync through SSH. Server hostname and username must be specified, either in the
configuration file, or on the command line (\(aq\-\-host\(aq and \(aq\-\-username\(aq options).
Currently only authentication with SSH key has been tested. The easiest way to connect to the
server is to use an ssh agent. Otherwise, if the SSH key is encrypted, it will be necessary
to enter the passphrase more than once. It is possible to specify the SSH key to use with the
option \(aq\-\-keyfile\(aq, if necessary.
